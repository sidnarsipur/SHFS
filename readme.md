# DFS

A fault tolerant distributed file system with heartbeat detection, automatic failure recovery, and dynamic file rebalancing base on server load.

## Prerequisites

Before building the project, make sure the following tools and libraries are installed:

* **CMake** (version 3.26 or above)
* **vcpkg** (for managing dependencies)
* **A C++20-compatible compiler**

### Installing Dependencies with vcpkg

1. **Install vcpkg** (if not already installed)

   Clone the vcpkg repository and run the installation script:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
   cd vcpkg
   ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies Using vcpkg**

   Once vcpkg is installed, use it to install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   ./vcpkg install grpc protobuf asio-grpc spdlog
   ```

   This will install the following dependencies:

   * `grpc` (gRPC library)
   * `protobuf` (Protocol Buffers)
   * `asio-grpc` (Asynchronous gRPC)
   * `spdlog` (Logging library)

   Ensure that the installed libraries are compatible with your environment.

## Building the Project

### Step 1: Create a Build Directory

```bash
mkdir build
```

### Step 2: Configure the Project

Use `cmake` to save a configuration for the project, specifying the vcpkg toolchain:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

### Step 3: Build the Project

After configuring the project, build it using:

```bash
cmake --build build
```

This will compile the source code and generate the necessary executables in the appropriate directories.

### Step 5: Running the executables

Run like so:

```bash
./build/src/client/client.exe
```

## Additional Information

### Precompiled headers

All library includes should be placed in `pch.h` to get the benefit of precompiled header speed up.

### Testing

To run tests, you can use an external Python script or manually invoke specific tests once youâ€™ve built the necessary components. Ensure your testing environment is set up properly according to your configuration.

### How to generate proto files automatically using CMake

1. Everytime you create a new .proto file, add it to the end of the `PROTOS` argument in `asio_grpc_protobuf_generate`:
    ```CMake
        asio_grpc_protobuf_generate(
            GENERATE_GRPC GENERATE_MOCK_CODE
            TARGET proto-objects
            USAGE_REQUIREMENT PUBLIC
            IMPORT_DIRS ${PROTO_IMPORT_DIRS}
            OUT_DIR "${PROTO_BINARY_DIR}"
            PROTOS
                "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/proto/hello.proto"
                "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/proto/naming.proto"
        )
    ```

2. Rebuild the `proto-objects` library in CLion
